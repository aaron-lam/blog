Inputs from other [[Neuron\|neuron]] ->
chemically-gated ion channels open ->
Changes in local membrane potential ->
causes opening/closes in voltage-gated ion channels in dendrites, body, and axon ->
result in depolarization (+ve change in voltage) / hyper polarization (-ve change in voltage) ->
Spike can occur if have strong enough depolarization
