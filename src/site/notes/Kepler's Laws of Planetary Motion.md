Johannes Kepler, using the meticulous observational data of Tycho Brahe, formulated three laws that accurately describe the motion of planets around the Sun. These laws were a major leap forward from [[Copernicus's Heliocentric Model\|Copernicus's Heliocentric Model]], which still assumed perfect circular orbits.

The Three Laws:

1.  **The Law of Ellipses**: The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. This broke from the ancient philosophical ideal of perfect circles.
2.  **The Law of Equal Areas**: A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. This means planets move faster when they are closer to the Sun.
3.  **The Law of Harmonies**: The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit (p² ∝ a³). This reveals a precise mathematical relationship between a planet's distance from the Sun and the time it takes to orbit.

Kepler's laws described _how_ the planets moved with unprecedented accuracy, but they did not explain _why_. The "why" would have to wait for [[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\|Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation]].
