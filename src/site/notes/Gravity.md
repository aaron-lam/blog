Gravity is the fundamental force of attraction between all things that have mass or energy. Understanding its nature has been a central quest in physics, marking the transition from ancient philosophy to modern science.

This hub connects the key milestones in our understanding of gravity:

- [[Copernicus's Heliocentric Model\|Copernicus's Heliocentric Model]]: The crucial first step in shifting our cosmic perspective away from the Earth-centered model of [[Aristotle's Cosmology\|Aristotle's Cosmology]].
- [[Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion\|Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion]]: Provided the precise mathematical description of _how_ planets move, discovering that orbits are elliptical, not circular.
- [[Galileo's Gravity Experiments\|Galileo's Gravity Experiments]]: Through experiments with falling objects and inclined planes, Galileo demonstrated that all objects accelerate at the same rate, regardless of their mass.
- [[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\|Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation]]: The grand synthesis that explained _why_ planets move as Kepler described and why apples fall as Galileo observed, uniting the heavens and the Earth under a single, universal law.

Our modern understanding of gravity would later be revolutionized by Einstein's theory of [[Relativity\|General Relativity]], which describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime.
