If [[Neuron\|neuron]] A repeatedly firing signal to neuron B, the [[Synapse\|synapse]] between neuron A and B strengthens. (Long term Potentiation)

If neuron A and B don't have correlation between firing, their synapse connection weakens. (Long Term Depression)

The LTP and LTD occurs heavily depends on the tight timing of neuron firing.
