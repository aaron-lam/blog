Cytoskeleton is a network of protein fibers that run throughout the cytoplasm. This network provides shape and structure to the cell, and helps hold organelles and other cell parts in place.

The cytoskeleton can change shape — it can be broken down and built up again, which allows it to play a key role in cell division, cell movement, and the transport of materials within and out of the cell.
