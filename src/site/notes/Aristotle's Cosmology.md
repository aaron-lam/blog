Aristotle's cosmology was a geocentric model of the universe that dominated Western thought for nearly 2,000 years. It placed a stationary Earth at the center, surrounded by a series of concentric crystalline spheres.

Key features:

- **Geocentric**: Earth is the unmoving center.
- **Two Realms**: A clear distinction between the "sublunary" (earthly) realm and the "superlunary" (celestial) realm.
  - The sublunary realm was imperfect, subject to change and decay, composed of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
  - The superlunary realm was perfect and eternal, composed of a fifth element, the "aether."
- **Natural Motion**: Objects sought their natural place. An apple fell because its nature was to return to the Earth.

This worldview provided a complete and intuitive, albeit incorrect, picture of the universe. It represents a monumental achievement in early [[Philosophy\|Philosophy]] but would eventually be overturned by the scientific revolution, starting with discoveries like [[Copernicus's Heliocentric Model\|Copernicus's Heliocentric Model]].
