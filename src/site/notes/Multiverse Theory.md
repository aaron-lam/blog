Multiverse theory is a set of hypotheses that proposes our universe is just one of many universes that together comprise a "multiverse."

There are several different scientific models that lead to the possibility of a multiverse:

- **Eternal Inflation**: In this model, the process of cosmic inflation that created our universe is constantly happening, spawning countless other "bubble universes" with potentially different physical laws and constants.
- **String Theory Landscape**: The equations of [[String Theory\|String Theory]] allow for a vast number of possible solutions, each corresponding to a unique vacuum state, or a universe with its own set of physical laws.
- **Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics**: This interpretation suggests that every quantum measurement causes the universe to split into multiple parallel universes, one for each possible outcome.

The concept of "bubble collisions" refers to the hypothetical interaction between two of these bubble universes in an eternal inflation scenario.

Like string theory, the multiverse is a highly speculative and philosophical area of modern physics, as testing these hypotheses is currently beyond our technological capabilities.
