Cytosol is the gel-like, water-based fluid that fills the space inside the cell between the plasma membrane and the nucleus.

Cytosol contains the cell’s organelles and is also where many chemical reactions occur. The cytosol plus all of the molecules and structures within it is referred to as the cell’s cytoplasm.
