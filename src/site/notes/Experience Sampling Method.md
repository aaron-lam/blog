The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is a research technique used to capture real-time data about individuals' thoughts, feelings, and activities as they go about their daily lives.

**How it works:**
Participants are prompted at random intervals throughout the day (often via a pager or smartphone app) to stop what they are doing and record information about their current state. This might include:

- What activity they are engaged in.
- Their current emotional state (e.g., rating happiness on a scale of 1-10).
- Their level of engagement or concentration.

**Why it's important:**
ESM helps overcome the limitations of recall bias, where people may not accurately remember how they felt during past events. It provides a more accurate, in-the-moment picture of daily life.

This method was pioneered by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and was instrumental in his research on [[Flow (Psychology)\|Flow (Psychology)]], as it allowed him to identify the conditions under which people reported being "in the zone."
