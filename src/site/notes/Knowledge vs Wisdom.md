Knowledge is the accumulation of facts and information, while wisdom is the ability to apply that knowledge with sound judgment, discernment, and a deep understanding of context.

- **Knowledge**: Knowing that a tomato is a fruit.
- **Wisdom**: Knowing not to put a tomato in a fruit salad.

Knowledge is about understanding _what_ is true. Wisdom is about understanding _why_ it matters and _how_ to use it effectively. It involves perspective, ethical consideration, and an appreciation for what we do not know, which connects to the idea of [[Islands of Knowledge\|Islands of Knowledge]].

In the context of personal growth, the pursuit of knowledge alone can be a form of [[Medium Maximization\|Medium Maximization]], where we focus on acquiring information rather than the ultimate goal of living a good life. True fulfillment often comes from the application of knowledge to achieve wisdom, a key theme in [[Psychology\|Psychology]].
