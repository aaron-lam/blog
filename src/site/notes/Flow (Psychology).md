Flow is a state of optimal experience, characterized by complete absorption in an activity. Coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, it is often referred to as being "in the zone."

The key characteristics of flow include:

- **Intense focus on the present moment**: Full concentration on the task at hand.
- **Lack of self-consciousness**: The sense of self dissolves, and concerns about what others think fade away.
- **Distorted perception of time**: Hours can feel like minutes. This provides a fascinating psychological parallel to the physical phenomenon of [[Time Dilation\|Time Dilation]].
- **A sense of personal control**: Feeling competent and in command of one's actions.
- **The activity is intrinsically rewarding**: The doing is its own reward, a hallmark of intrinsic motivation as described in [[Self-Determination Theory\|Self-Determination Theory]].

Flow occurs when there is a perfect balance between the challenge of a task and the skill of the performer. It is a powerful source of happiness and a key component of peak performance, standing in stark contrast to the distracting mental state of [[Superiority Seeking and Performance\|seeking superiority]].
