- Eukaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles. This means they have a membrane-bound nucleus which contains the cell’s genetic material.
- A eukaryotic cell’s genetic material is typically organized into multiple, linear, DNA chromosomes.
- Eukaryotic cells are relatively large, ranging from 10 to 100 micrometers (µm).
- Eukaryotes include both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Multicellular eukaryotes are made up of many eukaryotic cells.
