* Feature scaling
* Learning curve
* Feature engineering
* Polynomial Regression
## Logistic Regression
* Regularization
# Machine Learning Yearning
## Development set and test set
* test and development
* single number evaluation
## Error analysis
* eyeball and blackbox test
* mislabelled data
## Bias and variance
* Optimal error rate
* tradeoff
* technique to optimize
## Learning curves
Shows if we have high bias or high variance
## Human level performance
Helps to determine the benchmark
## Train data at distribution
The challenges, and the things to address (put some test data in training data to avoid overfit)
## Data mismatch
Use training dev set to debug
Artificial data beware
## Optimization verification
Use the score to apply both human result and test result to debug what to improve: the score algorithm or the learning algorithm
## End-to-end deep learning
Tradeoffs between end-to-end deep learning and pipeline model
How to debug on pipeline
