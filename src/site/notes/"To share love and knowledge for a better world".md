I am Aaron Lam, a software engineer at TikTok. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my family, playing music instruments, reading, writing, and drawing.

All my notes stem from my life purpose statement: "To [[Share\|Share]]  [[Love\|Love]] and [[Knowledge\|Knowledge]] for a better world" As I contemplate how to fulfill this purpose, more questions pops up from my head. How can I effectively share with others? How do I reach a larger audience? How can I be a loving person? What knowledge should I acquire? These questions drive me to create a blog that represents my knowledge base, aiming to answer them and maximize my contribution to the world before I'm gone.

I hope this blog inspires you. Enjoy!
