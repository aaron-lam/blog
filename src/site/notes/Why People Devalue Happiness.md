Despite nearly everyone claiming to want happiness, people often subconsciously devalue it due to a set of negative beliefs and a lack of clear definition.

There are three main reasons for this devaluation:

1.  **Negative Beliefs**: People often associate happiness with negative traits. They may believe that happy people are lazy, selfish, or that happiness is fleeting and will inevitably be followed by a crash.
2.  **Lack of a Concrete Definition**: Vague definitions of happiness make it difficult to know how to achieve it. This ambiguity, known as the "fluency effect," makes us less likely to pursue something because it doesn't feel concrete or achievable. A clearer, more actionable [[Defining Happiness\|definition of happiness]] is needed.
3.  **[[Medium Maximization\|Medium Maximization]]**: People often mistake the means for the end. They pursue money, status, or possessions, believing these are the path to happiness, but end up maximizing the medium rather than the ultimate goal of well-being.
