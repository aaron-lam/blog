An argument is considered sound if it is both valid AND all of its premises are actually true. A sound argument is therefore a valid argument with true premises.

## Example

Premise 1: All cats are mammals.

Premise 2: All mammals are plants.

Conclusion: Therefore, all cats are plants.

This argument is [[Valid Argument\|Valid Argument]] (the conclusion logically follows from the premises) but not sound (because premise 2 is false).
