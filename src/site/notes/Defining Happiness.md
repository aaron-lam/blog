To effectively cultivate happiness, we must move beyond vague notions and define it in concrete terms. A useful definition of happiness is a life filled with a high frequency of positive emotions, particularly those that are deep and connecting.

Three powerful, sustainable sources of positive emotions are:

1.  **Authentic Pride**: The feeling of accomplishment that comes from achieving mastery and progressing in skills and knowledge. For me, this is about growing as a software engineer and expanding my knowledge garden.
2.  **Love and Connection**: The warmth and security that comes from strong social bonds. For me, this is playing with my son and wife as a family.
3.  **Abundance**: A feeling of gratitude and contentment, recognizing the good things one already has. For me, this is having the time to read and learn about new and interesting domains.

Unlike fleeting pleasures, these sources of happiness are often pro-social and contribute to long-term well-being. Focusing on these concrete pillars helps to overcome the vagueness that leads to [[Why People Devalue Happiness\|devaluing happiness]].
