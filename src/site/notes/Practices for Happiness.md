Beyond understanding the theories of happiness, there are specific, evidence-based practices that can be cultivated to increase well-being. This hub connects key practices that shift our mindset and daily habits.

## Core Practices

- [[Self-Compassion\|Self-Compassion]]: The practice of treating oneself with the same kindness and understanding that one would offer to a good friend.
- [[Gratitude\|Gratitude]]: The practice of recognizing and appreciating the good things in one's life, which helps to counteract negative biases and the drive for superiority.

These practices are not quick fixes, but rather skills that can be developed over time to build a more resilient and fulfilling inner life. They provide the "how" that complements the "what" and "why" from the other psychological theories.
