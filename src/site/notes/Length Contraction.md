Length contraction is the phenomenon where the length of a moving object is measured to be shorter than its proper length (the length as measured in the object's own rest frame). This contraction only occurs in the direction of motion.

Like [[Time Dilation\|Time Dilation]], length contraction is a direct consequence of the [[Principle of Relativity\|Principle of Relativity]]. Because the speed of light must be constant for all observers, space and time must warp to accommodate relative motion. If time slows down for a moving object, space must contract in its direction of motion.

This effect is not an illusion; it is a genuine physical property of spacetime. However, it is only noticeable at relativistic speeds. From the perspective of the moving object, its own length is normal, but the space it is traveling through appears contracted.
