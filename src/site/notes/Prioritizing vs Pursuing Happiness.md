A key strategy for a happier life is to _prioritize_ happiness, not _pursue_ it directly.

- **Pursuing Happiness**: This involves chasing happy feelings as a goal in itself. This approach often backfires, as focusing too much on wanting to be happy can lead to disappointment and a sense of failure. It turns happiness into a moving target.
- **Prioritizing Happiness**: This involves making decisions and building habits that create the conditions for happiness to arise naturally. It means consistently choosing activities and mindsets that align with your [[Defining Happiness\|definition of happiness]].

For example, instead of thinking "I need to feel happy right now," you would prioritize activities like spending quality time with family, working on a challenging skill, or practicing [[Gratitude\|Gratitude]].

This approach treats happiness not as a fleeting emotional state to be caught, but as a byproduct of a well-lived life. It is about building the garden, not chasing the butterflies.
