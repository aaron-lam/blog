Medium maximization is the cognitive bias where we focus on a medium or proxy for a goal, rather than the goal itself. In the context of happiness, this means chasing things like money, status, or possessions at the expense of actual well-being.

The medium (e.g., money) becomes the end-in-itself. We evolved in a world of scarcity where accumulating resources was directly tied to survival and well-being. In the modern world, this link is weaker, but our psychological drive remains.

Recognizing this bias is the first step toward re-orienting one's life to [[Prioritizing vs Pursuing Happiness\|prioritize happiness]] directly, rather than chasing its proxies. This connects to the philosophical distinction between instrumental and intrinsic goods, where [[Knowledge vs Wisdom\|wisdom]] is knowing what is truly of intrinsic value.
