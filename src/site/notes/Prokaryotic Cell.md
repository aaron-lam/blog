* Prokaryotic cells lack membrane-bound organelles. Instead, they have a nucleoid, which is a region in the cell where the genetic material is located.
- A prokaryotic cell’s genetic material is typically organized into a single, circular DNA chromosome that is coiled up to fit inside the cell.
- Prokaryotic cells are relatively small, ranging from 1 to 10 micrometers (µm).
- Prokaryotes are typically unicellular organisms. However, some can live together as a group in which certain cells take on specialized roles.
