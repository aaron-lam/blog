Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is a broad theory of human motivation and personality that suggests all humans have three innate, universal psychological needs. The fulfillment of these needs is essential for well-being, engagement, and optimal functioning.

The three core needs are:

1.  **Autonomy**: The need to feel in control of one's own behaviors and goals. It is about having a sense of free will and choice.
2.  **Competence**: The need to feel effective in dealing with the environment. It involves seeking to control outcomes and experience mastery.
3.  **Relatedness**: The need to have close, affectionate relationships with others. It is about the universal desire to interact, be connected to, and experience caring for others.

When these three needs are met, people are more likely to be intrinsically motivated, leading to greater creativity, persistence, and happiness. This provides a clear framework for understanding [[Why We Seek Superiority\|Why We Seek Superiority]] (as a proxy for competence and autonomy) and also why a balanced approach that includes relatedness is crucial for a good life.
