Gratitude is the practice of recognizing and appreciating the good things in one's life. It is a powerful tool for increasing well-being and has several key psychological benefits:

1.  **It Shifts Focus to the Positive**: Gratitude actively counteracts the brain's natural negativity bias by forcing us to pay attention to what is going well.
2.  **It Fosters an Other-Centered Mindset**: By recognizing that we receive good things from others, gratitude moves us away from a self-centered perspective toward one of connection and appreciation for others. This promotes feelings of love, which are more sustainable than the hubristic pride associated with superiority.
3.  **It Mitigates the Need for Superiority**: When we are grateful for what we have, the desire to constantly compare ourselves to others and acquire more is diminished. It helps to break the cycle of the [[Harmful Effects of Superiority Seeking\|hedonic treadmill]].
