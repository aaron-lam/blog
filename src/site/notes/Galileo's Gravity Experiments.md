Galileo Galilei's experiments with falling objects were fundamental to developing our modern understanding of gravity. He systematically challenged the Aristotelian idea that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones.

Through a series of experiments, famously (though perhaps apocryphally) including dropping objects from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and more verifiably by rolling balls down inclined planes, Galileo discovered a key principle:

**In the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the same constant acceleration.**

This was a revolutionary insight. It demonstrated that the nature of falling objects was independent of their mass, a direct contradiction of the principles from [[Aristotle's Cosmology\|Aristotle's Cosmology]].

Galileo's emphasis on empirical evidence and mathematical analysis of experimental results was a hallmark of the scientific revolution. His work on motion laid the essential groundwork for [[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\|Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation]].
