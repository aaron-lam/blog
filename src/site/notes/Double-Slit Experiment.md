The double-slit experiment is the quintessential demonstration of wave-particle duality and the strangeness of the quantum world.

**The Setup:**

1.  A beam of particles (like electrons or photons) is fired at a barrier with two thin, parallel slits.
2.  A detector screen is placed behind the barrier to record where the particles land.

**The Results:**

- If you fire the particles one at a time _without_ observing which slit they go through, they create an interference pattern on the screenâ€”a series of bright and dark bands. This pattern is a hallmark of waves interfering with each other, implying each particle somehow went through _both_ slits at once.
- If you place a detector at the slits to see which one each particle goes through, the interference pattern vanishes. The particles behave like simple bullets, creating two distinct bands on the screen.

**The Implication:**
The act of observation forces a quantum system to "choose" a single state, collapsing its wave function. This experiment fundamentally challenges our [[Classical Physics Worldview\|classical intuition]] about reality, suggesting that, at a deep level, reality is probabilistic and influenced by measurement. This raises profound questions, echoing the themes in [[Plato's Allegory of the Cave\|Plato's Allegory of the Cave]] about the difference between perceived reality and true reality.
