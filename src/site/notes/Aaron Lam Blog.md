I am Aaron Lam, a software engineer with a passion for continuous learning and personal growth. When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in a good book, playing piano, or cherishing moments with my family.

This blog serves as my digital garden â€” a carefully cultivated collection of insights, experiences, and knowledge I've gathered along my journey. It's designed to be a personal wiki, a hub where I can reflect on my progress and revisit the materials I've learned.

Whether you're a fellow coder, a lifelong learner, or simply a curious soul, I hope you'll find something here that resonates with you. Feel free to wander, explore, and perhaps discover something new.
