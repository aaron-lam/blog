Modern Physics encompasses the theories of the 20th and 21st centuries that explore the universe at its smallest scales (quantum mechanics) and its largest scales (cosmology), often pushing the boundaries of what we know.

This hub connects several key concepts at the forefront of modern physics:

- [[Higgs Boson\|Higgs Boson]]: The particle associated with the Higgs field, which gives fundamental particles their mass. Its discovery was a major confirmation of the Standard Model of particle physics.
- [[String Theory\|String Theory]]: A theoretical framework that attempts to be a "theory of everything," positing that the fundamental constituents of reality are not point-like particles but tiny, vibrating one-dimensional strings.
- [[Multiverse Theory\|Multiverse Theory]]: A collection of hypotheses suggesting that our universe is not the only one, but is part of a larger collection of parallel universes.

These topics represent the frontier of our [[Islands of Knowledge\|Islands of Knowledge]], where theoretical ideas are complex and experimental verification is incredibly challenging.
