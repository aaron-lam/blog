Self-compassion involves extending compassion to oneself in instances of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general suffering. Researcher Kristin Neff defines it as having three main components:

1.  **Self-Kindness vs. Self-Judgment**: Being warm and understanding toward ourselves when we suffer, fail, or feel inadequate, rather than ignoring our pain or flagellating ourselves with self-criticism.
2.  **Common Humanity vs. Isolation**: Recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy are part of the shared human experience â€“ something that we all go through rather than being something that happens to "me" alone.
3.  **Mindfulness vs. Over-Identification**: Taking a balanced approach to our negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated. We observe our negative thoughts and emotions with openness and clarity, so that they are held in mindful awareness.

Self-compassion is distinct from self-esteem; it is not based on positive evaluations of oneself, but rather on a kind and forgiving attitude, which makes it a more stable source of well-being.
