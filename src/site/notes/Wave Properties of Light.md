Light, when behaving as a wave, can be described by several fundamental properties that are interconnected.

- **Speed (c)**: In a vacuum, the speed of light is a universal constant, approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. This constancy is a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of [[Relativity\|Special Relativity]].
- **Wavelength (λ)**: This is the spatial period of the wave—the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It determines the color of visible light.
- **Frequency (f)**: This is the number of wave crests that pass a point per unit of time.

These three properties are related by a simple and fundamental equation:
\[ c = \lambda f \]
**Speed = Wavelength × Frequency**

This relationship means that for a wave traveling at a constant speed, a longer wavelength corresponds to a lower frequency, and a shorter wavelength corresponds to a higher frequency. This is the foundational principle behind the entire [[Electromagnetic Waves\|electromagnetic spectrum]].
