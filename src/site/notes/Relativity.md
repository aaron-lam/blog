Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, is a cornerstone of modern physics that fundamentally altered our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe. It is divided into two main theories: Special Relativity and General Relativity.

This hub connects the core concepts of Einstein's theories:

- [[Principle of Relativity\|Principle of Relativity]]: The foundational idea that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers.
- [[Time Dilation\|Time Dilation]]: The counter-intuitive effect where time can pass at different rates for different observers.
- [[Length Contraction\|Length Contraction]]: The effect where the length of an object is measured to be shorter when it is moving relative to an observer.
- [[Principle of Equivalence\|Principle of Equivalence]]: The deep connection between gravity and acceleration, which serves as the bridge from Special to General Relativity.
- [[Spacetime Curvature\|Spacetime Curvature]]: The central concept of General Relativity, where gravity is not a force but a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
- [[Cosmological Constant and Dark Energy\|Cosmological Constant and Dark Energy]]: An extension of Einstein's theories to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe.
