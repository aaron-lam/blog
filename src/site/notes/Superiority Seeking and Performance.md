While the desire for superiority can be a powerful motivator, research suggests it can paradoxically decrease performance in tasks that require deep cognitive effort.

A study from Duke University found that when individuals were motivated by a desire to be superior to their peers, their performance on complex cognitive tasks suffered. This is likely because a significant portion of their mental bandwidth was consumed by social comparison and anxiety about their standing, rather than being fully dedicated to the task itself.

This highlights the difference between two types of motivation:

- **Extrinsic Motivation**: Being driven by external rewards like status, money, or being seen as the best.
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Being driven by internal rewards like curiosity, passion, and the joy of the task itself.

For tasks requiring creativity, problem-solving, and deep focus, intrinsic motivation is far more effective. A state of [[Flow (Psychology)\|Flow (Psychology)]], which is highly conducive to peak performance, is incompatible with the self-conscious state of mind that comes from [[Harmful Effects of Superiority Seeking\|seeking superiority]].
