Regression predicts continuous numerical values, while classification predicts discrete categories or classes.

**Regression Examples:**

- Predicting house prices (output: dollar amount)
- Forecasting temperature (output: degrees)
- Estimating stock prices (output: price value)

**Classification Examples:**

- Email spam detection (output: spam/not spam)
- Image recognition (output: cat/dog/bird)
- Medical diagnosis (output: disease/healthy)

Both types use [[Cost Function\|Cost Function]] to measure performance, but regression typically uses mean squared error while classification uses log-likelihood or cross-entropy loss.

The choice affects which algorithms and [[Optimization\|Optimization]] techniques work best for your problem.
