Time dilation is a direct consequence of the [[Principle of Relativity\|Principle of Relativity]], stating that time passes more slowly for a moving observer as measured by a stationary observer. This effect becomes significant only at speeds approaching the speed of light.

Essentially, "moving clocks run slow."

This isn't a mechanical or psychological effect; it is a fundamental property of spacetime. Time itself is relative. For example, the clocks on GPS satellites must be constantly corrected for time dilation effects (both from Special and General Relativity) to function accurately.

This physical relativity of time provides an interesting parallel to the subjective experience of time in [[Psychology\|Psychology]]. The perception of time can be distorted during intense focus, as described in the concept of [[Flow (Psychology)\|Flow (Psychology)]], where one can lose all track of time. While the mechanisms are completely different, both concepts challenge the notion of a single, objective, universal time.
