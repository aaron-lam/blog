1. Brain isn't as good at learning as we thought. Thinking consumes lots of energy, so our body tends to use the visual system to complete the task instead of using brain. In our daily lives, most of our tasks are completed with unconsciousness, like driving, brushing teeth, etc.
2. Curiosity helps students to get interested into the subject and increase desire to learn. However, curiosity only last for a very short time.
