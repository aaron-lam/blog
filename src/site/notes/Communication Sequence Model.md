1. Linear model: In the early days, researchers believed that communication was linear: one speaks words, transmits the message to others, and another receives the message.

2.  Exchange model: The exchange model is considered more accurate because the linear model oversimplifies communication interactions. The exchange model takes into account the background and context of the two people involved in the conversation. For example, when someone says something potentially offensive, the receiver's unpleasant facial expression might prompt the speaker to stop speaking immediately before delivering the full message.
