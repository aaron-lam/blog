End-to-end deep learning trains a single neural network to map directly from input to output, replacing traditional multi-step pipelines.

**Traditional pipeline example (speech recognition):**
Audio → Features → Phonemes → Words → Transcript

**End-to-end approach:**
Audio → Transcript (single neural network)

**Advantages:**

- Automatically learns intermediate representations
- Eliminates hand-designed feature engineering
- Can discover patterns humans might miss
- Simpler system architecture

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires massive amounts of data
- Less interpretable than pipeline components
- Harder to debug individual components
- May need more computational resources

**When to use end-to-end:**

- Large datasets available (typically millions of examples)
- Task is complex with many pipeline stages
- Traditional approaches are hard to optimize

**When to use pipelines:**

- Limited data available
- Need interpretability for individual components
- Existing pipeline components work well
- Want to optimize individual stages separately

The choice impacts your [[Error Analysis\|Error Analysis]] approach and debugging strategies.
