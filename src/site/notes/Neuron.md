Neuron is like a leaky bag of charged liquid. It is the fundamental building blocks of the brain. Information would flow from dendrites to axon via the cell body.

Contents of the neuron enclosed within a cell membrane. The cell membrane contains ion channels, which allows ion to flow in or out. Ionic channels are also selective, allow only specific ions to pass through.

Each neuron maintains a potential difference across its membrane (-70 mV for inside; 0mV for outside). Ionic pumps maintains -70mV difference by expelling Na+ out and allowing K+ ions in.
